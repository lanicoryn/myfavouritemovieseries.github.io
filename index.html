          <h2><span>1. </span>Harry Potter</h2>
          <p>After the death of his parents, young Harry Potter lives with his aunt and uncle, where he is treated badly and has to endure constant bullying from his spoiled nephew. On his 11th birthday, Harry learns that his parents were powerful wizards and that he too has unique magical powers. He leaves for a British boarding school for student wizards, where he makes new friends who, like him, have special powers. Despite his intrepid deeds and valiant adventures, all he really wanted was to enjoy Hogwarts with his friends and be left alone by Nasty Teachers and Dark Wizards and their Nefarious plans. Harry Potter had a vicious case of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Always.</p>

          <p>It is difficult to summarise this because Marvel has so many movies. But they are basically all super hero movies and over the course of the years all the superheroes form a team and fight evil togheter. This team is called the Avengers and super heroes like Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Black Widow, Thor and many more are in it. The first villian they fight together is Loki. After that came some more Avengers movie which have now ended with Thanos as the villain. But besides the Avengers movies most of the superheroes have seperate movies themselves. Stories about how they became superheroes and stuff.</p>
